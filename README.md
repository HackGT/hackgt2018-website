# hackgt2018-website [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HackGT/hackgt2018-website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HackGT/hackgt2018-website)

Edit individual sections in the `/src/pages` directory. Files are sorted alphabetically for simplicity. There are also two
other important files, `/src/header.html` and `/src/footer.html`.

Build the project (just once):
```
gulp
```

(That's the default task.)

Build the project and then watch for changes:
```
gulp watch
```
The project will be built each time you make changes.
