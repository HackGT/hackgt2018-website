            <p>At the end of the day, we throw events to show everyone the beauty of Computer Science. Down to the smallest of details, our goal is to enable every single participant to have fun, engage with new ideas, and create lasting positive memories with new friends. This yearâ€™s theme brings all of the aforementioned elements together in a beautiful wrapper named nature. With the sunny skies, lush greenery, and computers for days, the adventures are endless. On October 19th, come out for one of the greatest adventures ever.</p>
