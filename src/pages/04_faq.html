                    <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
                    <p>Bring your laptop, charger, headphones, and anything else you need. We'll supply hardware, meals, and snacks.</p>

                    <h3>Where is HackGT 5?</h3>
                    <p>The event will be taking place on Georgia Tech campus in the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Tqnadk8yaGA2">Klaus Advanced Computing Building.</a></p>                    

                    <h3>Who is eligible?</h3>
                    <p>Any student over the age of 18 enrolled in a college or university is allowed to participate, but anyone can be a mentor or volunteer. Teams can be up to four members - you can register with your team when you apply, or any time after you’re accepted, but you can also create a team at the event!</p>
                    <p>If you are younger than 18, but a Georgia Tech student, you can still participate.</p>

                    <h3>Are there any costs?</h3>
                    <p>The event is free, thanks to our sponsors! We will offer travel reimbursement -- just indicate where you’re coming from when you apply, and we’ll reach out to you.</p>

                    <h3>Can I use past projects?</h3>
                    <p>True to the spirit of hackathons, you may not submit your past projects to HackGT.</p>

                    <h3>Do I need any experience to apply?</h3>
                    <p>No! Experience is not required. Hackathons are open environments for everyone. If you’re a GT student, make sure to like our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HackGT/">Facebook page</a> for updates on HackGTeeny, our workshop-filled day of hackathon prep exclusive for Georgia Tech students.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What are Campsites?</h3>
                    <p>Think office hours - regroup, refocus, re-engage! Each path will have the opportunity to come together, meet face to face, and receive specialized help from our mentors and sponsors throughout the event.</p>
