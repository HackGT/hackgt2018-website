                    <p>Bring your laptop, charger, headphones, and anything else you need. We'll supply hardware, meals, and snacks. More to come soon!</p>

                    <h2>Who is eligible?</h2>
                    <p>Any student over the age of 18 enrolled in a college or university is allowed to participate, but anyone can be a mentor or volunteer.

                    <h2>Are there any costs?</h2>
                    <p>The event is free, thanks to our sponsors! We will offer travel reimbursement -- just indicate where you’re coming from when you apply, and we’ll reach out to you.</p>

                    <h2>Can I use past projects?</h2>
                    <p>True to the spirit of hackathons, you may not submit your past projects to HackGT.</p>

                    <h2>Do I need any experience to apply?</h2>
                    <p>Experience isn’t required. Hackathons are a place to learn for anybody at any level. Some of our past winners are also first-timers at a hackathon. But, if you’re still not convinced, like our Facebook page for updates about workshops or events we’ll host before HackGT that’ll teach you some introductory skills!</p>
