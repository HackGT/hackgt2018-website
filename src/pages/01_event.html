        Looking to inspire and challenge our attendees, HackGT's 5th annual signature 36-hour hackathon will help students develop their skills, explore new technologies, and turn their curiosities into reality. Participants will be welcomed by friendly campgrounds, lush landscapes, and a spirit of adventure â€” inspired by the diverse beauty of America's National Parks from Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon to the Olympic Peninsula and Denali.
